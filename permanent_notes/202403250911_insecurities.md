# Insecurities or the lack of it

I remember the time when I went to college and found that I had lot to learn. The most shocking was my communication and I saw people communicating in english. 
I felt a bit out of the place. I felt insecure. Almost everybody I started talking, they were able to tell that I am from Rajasthan because of my accent. I never used to tell that I belong to village in Rajasthan. 
I started to feel like I am not good enough. I have had big ambitions but I felt like I am not good enough as I do not have the communication skills. 
I always try to hide my background. I never lied but I used to avoid too much details about my background. I used to feel that people will judge me based on my background.
