# Title

This question had given me sleepless nights. I have worked on several projects where I had to make a trade-off between quality and speed. I always believed that it is not possible to achieve both quality and speed. But over the years, I have realized that the trade-off is not always necessary. 

We cant escape the question on quality saying that we were prioritizing speed. While we know that quality is subjective and speed is also somewhat subjective. If someone says the speed is slow, its not necessary that it is slow for everyone. Most often its slow for you because you are the one who gave the timelines. 

I will not get into the details of how to estimate the timelines. But I will share my thoughts on how to achieve both quality and speed.

## Quality and Speed

Although quality is subjective, we can still define it. I would not go into it rather I would ask you to discuss with your collegues or senior members in your team. 
I would also encourage you to read lots of code and go through popular libraries and frameworks. This will help you in understanding what is quality code.

Whats the good speed? I would say that if you are able to deliver the project before the deadline, then you are fast. 
The deadline is the most important thing here. 

## How to achieve both?

It hard to do justice with both. But I have seen people doing it.

I think you should develop a sense of how do you view the quality. Because you will find that the quality is not same for every place. Some place will have high quality standards and some will have low. If you end up delivering high quality code in a place where low quality is acceptable, then you are slow.

So, the first thing is to understand the quality standards of the place where you are working. But it doesnt mean that you should compromise on the quality. You should always aim for the quality. You should know the benefits of delivering high quality work. 

The second thing is to understand the deadlines. You should know the deadlines and you should be able to estimate the timelines.

The third thing is to understand the trade-offs. You should know what you are trading off. If you are trading off the quality, then you should know the consequences.

The fourth thing is to understand the impact of the project. You should know the impact of the project. If the project is not going to have a big impact, then you should not spend much time on it.

I believe a bare minimum quality standard you should always keep. Use it as guiding force whenever you are trading off the quality.

Any speed is bad if it does not meet minimum quality standards. 

Lets take an example, 

Sundar is working as senior engineer at a software company. Product team comes to him and ask him to build a feature. Product team want to release the feature in 2 weeks.
