I was thinking about this a while ago and I thought I should write it down.
How to shape up the data science narrative within the company? Data Science team's success depends on how they are being perceived within the company. If a company just use the AI and ML terms for marketing, then data science team will not be able to create impact. 

First, data science should get a seat at the table. Once you have that it becomes easy to shape up the narrative. Most companies don't have that, so how do you shape up the narrative?

I am going to share some of the things that I have learned from my experience. What exactly I mean by shaping the data science narrative?
It means that data science team has product-market fit within the company where the top leadership of the company understands the importance of the data science team. 
Just think about the placement of the engineering team and product team within the company. Both functions are essential for the company. What about the data science team?
The question itself poses a threat. Before I dive further. I will share how data science and ML teams are perceived and their importance within the company.

There are still companies who think data science and ML is not an essential function. They think that data science is just a support function. When you look at data science teams across companies, you will find that there is too much noise in what kind of work they do. Many data science teams are just doing analytics and business intelligence work. People need to realize that data engineering, data analytics and data science are different functions.
To be honest, I am the person who has done all three functions. I have done data engineering, data analytics and data science. 

Many times companies hire data scientists very early in their journey. They don't have the right infrastructure to support data science teams. So data scientists end up doing all the data engineering work. Because before you do any work, data needs to be there. This end up taking too much time as they are not the data engineers and it keeps mounting tech debt in terms of data engineering.
When I was struggling data scientist, we interacted with many data teams across companies. One person said, before you hire data scientist, you need to hire data engineers. Thats pretty good advice. 

Shaping the narrative depends in the company depends upon the data maturity of the company. If the company is not data-driven, then it will be very difficult to shape the narrative.
First we need to believe that data science can help every company regardless of the industry. Some might feel that data science is not for them.  

Lets divide the companies into two categories:

- early-stage startups: This type of companies are just starting out. They are still figuring out the product-market fit. They are still figuring out the business model. As the company grows, its important to hire a data person. If you feel the need to look at data more often, then its time to hire a data person.    
- mid-stage startups: 
- late stage startups 







Dont become just support system for other teams, try to build you own product. 
Figure out the most important problems for the company. Try to solve them. This is not going to be easy because data science team's success depends on multiple other teams like data engineering team, product team, engineering team, etc. You need to work with them and make sure that you are able to solve the problem.
