# Work Habits

- real todo list is calendar. If its not on calendar, it wont get done. It has to factor in number of hours in workday. 

-  Before finishing work for the {day/week}, plan out your next {day/week}
   Review calendar, schedule meetings & schedule pre-reads to go out
- setup break events in the calendar
- plan the next day at the end of the day, before taking off.
