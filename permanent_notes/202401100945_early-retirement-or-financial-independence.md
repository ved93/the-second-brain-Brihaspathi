# Early retirement- A myth or reality?

You often come across these two terms: Early Retirement and Financial Independence.

I will share my perspective on these two. After reading this, you will be able to decide which one you want to pursue.

It might happen that you have misunderstood these and after retirement you might feel that you never wanted early retirement. So lets understand these two terms.

## Early Retirement

Early retirement is when you retire early from your job. You have enough money to sustain your lifestyle and you don't need to work anymore.

You can pursue your hobbies, spend time with family, travel the world, and do whatever you want to do. You dont have to take permission for long leaves and you dont have to worry about your boss. You are free to do whatever you want to do.

## Financial Independence

Financial independence is when you have enough money to sustain your lifestyle. You don't need to work anymore for money. Now you can stay in the job you like, you can switch career you want. 


## Which one to choose?

Earlier I was thinking about early retirement. I thought I would travel and do whatever I wanted to. Then Later I realized for people like me, its very hard to sit empty. So may be I will work but on my own terms. This led me to financial independence. I realised that whether I will retire or not thats next question after I reach financial independence.

IMO, we all have wrong notion of retirement. We think we are done working and now we want to enjoy. But thats not true for most of people. Its very hard spending time doing nothing.
You might think you will just travel the world and enjoy. But after a while, you will get bored of it. You will start looking for something to do. You will start looking for some work. You will start looking for some purpose. 

The concept of retirement is very new. It was introduced in 1889 by German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck. He introduced it to get rid of older people from the workforce. He wanted to make space for younger people.
If you plan to retire by 60-65 yrs, thats fine. But if you plan to retire by age of 30-40 yrs, then you will have to think about what you will do after retirement.


So, I would suggest you to choose financial independence. It gives you more freedom and flexibility. You can choose to work on things that you are passionate about. You can choose to stay in low paying job if you like the work and you like the people you work with. You can decide the terms of your work.

You can take longer-term horizon of your life. You can decide the terms of your work. You are just working to satiate your curiosity. You are not working for money.  

We all should focus a lot on financial independence. It gives you more freedom and flexibility.
I dont remember the name of the person, when a reporter asked him, "what is your dream job?"
He replied, "I dont dream for a job"

I think we have been taught wrong about retirement and jobs. I will share my perspective. First, be employable and have the confidence in you.

Then work aggresively for your financial independence. Choose brand names in early part of your career. It will help you in long run. You will get better opportunities. You will get better pay. You will get better work. You will get better people to work with. Once you get the brand name, then optimize for salary growth. It feels bad to go to your manager and ask for salary hike. 
Think of this way, you have something valuable to offer to the company and you are charging for it. 
Remember, Joker from Batman movie, "If you are good at something, never do it for free"

Once you reach financial independence, then you can choose to work on things that you are passionate about. You can choose to stay in low paying job if you like the work and you like the people you work with. You can decide the terms of your work. Most of all, you dont have any fear of losing job. 

Remember, life was not given to be slave of your job. job is just a tool. Use it wisely. Today's world is different. Your job is no longer safe today. You are just a number just like your employee number. Think about it. 
Take the job you like.
