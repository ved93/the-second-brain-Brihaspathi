I have been thinking about it and seeing people advising other people to move to dev career after years of experience in other career. 

I will be the devils advocate here and present a case that dev career might not be best suggestion if you have years of experience in PM career. 

Switching to dev career can be excellent choice if 

- You are early in your career and may be around 2-5 years of experience.
- The pay is not good.
- You love software engineering.


What if you are over 8-10 years of experience in PM career. And you feel like stuck because of the pay and career growth. You look at the software developers and feel like they are getting paid more and have better career growth. What should you do?

Should you move to dev career? Should you become software engineer?

Let's go through Anurag's case.
Anurag is 8-10 yrs experienced PM. He is not happy with his career growth and pay. He is thinking about moving to dev career. He is thinking about becoming software engineer. After thinking for a while, he decides to become software engineer. He starts learning software engineering. He finds it overwhelming to learn. One good thing is that over the period of being PM, he worked with several engineers. So they help him and recommend the right courses. They give him the confidence that its easy to learn. To clear any job interview you need two things- you should know descently well and you should be good at communication. You have over 10 yrs of experience so you are good at communication. You just need to learn software engineering.
Anurag spent around 10-12 months learning software engineering. He learns about data structures, algorithms, system design, etc. He starts applying but he is not getting interview calls. Around 2 months of trying and iterating, he starts getting interview calls. Few interviews he was not able to clear it. Then he works on the feedback and starts clearing interviews. He gets an offer from a startup. HR knows that this person is switching career so Anurag doesnt get the best deal. Anurag was applying for SDE 1 role. HR still gets him the best SDE 1 offer which is close to half of his PM salary. Anurag doesnt have options so he takes the offer. He is happy that he is finally a software engineer. He joins the company and starts working. He finds it difficult to gel with the team. Most of the people in his team are way junior to him so there is a bit of gap. Anurag is good at making friends so he makes friends with his team. So he gets comfortable with the team and starts contributing to the team. He finds it difficult as he is new to the team. He works hard and starts contributing to the team. Now, Anurag is not like other freshers. He keeps on applying for jobs. 
Lets say good things happen to good people. No, I didnt mean that. Random things happens in the world. Somehow Anurag's CV reaches a startup founder and He feels impressed with Anurag's journey and he need exactly that kind of person in the team.
Its a startup so they dont have much money. But they are willing to pay Anurag 20% more than his current salary. Now Anurag has a BATNA and he also know that there will be lot of pressure in the job given its a startup. Anurag wants to get into FAANG companies. He pass on this opportunity and keeps working in the current company. He spends around a year in the company and Finally, he gets the job at Microsoft. He is happy that he is finally in FAANG company. He gets good salary and now he earns more than his PM salary. 
This entire process took around 2-3 years. 

In which cases above is a good decision for Anurag?

- Anurag thinks his career is going to be long i.e. 20-40 years. If he is going to work this long then its better to look at the future prospects. Here, it's implicit that you dont find the software engineering work boring. 
- Anurag loves software engineering. 2-3 yrs looks like a small cost to pay for the long-term benefits. 
  
In which cases above is a bad decision for Anurag?

- 2-3 yrs going to be a roller coaster journey. He is going to good amount of time to learning something from scratch. 
- He chosen dev career only for a better career prospectus. He finds that there is lot of boring work as well.
- Work-life balance was disturbed. He was not able to spend more time with  family and friends.
- Anuarg did not intend to have a long career. He wanted to retire early.  
- Anurag needs to work harder than his PM jobs because he is new to the field.


Now, lets see what could have happened if Anurag would have stayed in PM career and explored other career and taken advantage of his skills.

- It looks like Anurag's career reached a peak in terms of pay. If it happened then I think he is making decent amount of money. 
- Anuarg has become good at what he does. It takes less time for him to do the same work. He is able to spend more time with family and friends.
- Anurag started exploring consultant work for the startups. His experience can come handy for startups. He can start charging for his time. This can also lead him to a good offer. 
- Anurag started learning about investing. I believe learning investing can pay him return in the long term.


I have made Anurag's case a bit extreme. But I think it's a good case to think about.  


I think what if Anurag takes this investing skill seriously and starts learning it?
Would it be useful for him? How to decide if it's useful for him?
