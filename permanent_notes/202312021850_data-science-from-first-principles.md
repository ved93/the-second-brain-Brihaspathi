# first principles

Building machine learning solutions can be intimidating task. First, you need to frame the problem statement and then you need to figure out the data sources. Once you have the data, you need to figure out the feature engineering and model building. Once you have the model, you need to figure out the deployment and integration with other services. 

I have seen people getting overwhelmed with the complexity of the problem. Even I have been overwhelmed in the early days of my career. Over the period of time, I have realized that the complexity is not that complex. It is just that we are not able to see the problem from first principles.

First principles thinking is a method of inquiry and problem solving. It is a way of breaking down complex problems into basic elements and then reassemble them from the ground up. It is a way of thinking that helps you to develop a deep understanding of the problem.

I have seen people building complex models without understanding the problem. They just follow the steps that they have seen in the papers or in the blogs without understanding the problem. This is not the right way to build machine-learning solutions.

I want to share my thoughts on how to build machine-learning solutions from first principles.

## Framing the problem statement

The first step in building machine learning solutions is to frame the problem statement. This is the most important step in building machine learning solutions. If you don't frame the problem statement correctly, then you will end up building the wrong model. This is not everybody's cup of tea. It requires deep understanding of the business and the problem. You need to understand the business problem and the data sources. 

So how to undertsand the problem more? Are there ways to it? Yes, there are.

Talk to the buiness stakeholders and be curious ask dumb questions. You will be surprised to see the answers. The thing about dumb questions is that they are not dumb. They are the questions that you should ask. They will help you to understand the problem more. Get in the customer's shoes and try to understand the problem from their perspective. Believe me, you will get a lot of insights.

I worked on a project where I used to call users to understand their pain-points related to the problem. This turned about to be the most important step in the project. It led us to define the problem statement correctly and the new insights also helped product team to build better products. To give you a little bit more context, I worked on project where we were trying to predict the response intent of the user for a lead generation platform. I also shadowed the users to understand how they were using the platform. This helped me to understand the problem more. 
All this presented me with a clear picture of the problem. Because of this, we were able to understand why the users were behaving certain way and helped us to frame the problem statement correctly.

You can find many more examples like this. The point is that you should understand the problem more. You should not just rely on the data. You should understand the problem from first principles.
