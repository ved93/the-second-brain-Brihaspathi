# title

This story goes to the time when I was in class 9th. I was in a boarding school and we were not allowed to go outside the school boundary. We had this one big campus to roam around. We didn't have any phone booth to call our homes.
One fine day I was just thinking sitting in my dorm and an insight crossed my mind. None of the toppers in class 10th,11th and 12th were the same toppers who used to top before 10th class. We used to see new faces as toppers in class 10th. I asked some of my seniors to know more about previous batches and their own classes. I found that pattern was almost consistent. That's when I thought I need to do something. I decided I will not top in class 9th. I decided I would go for 2nd position. After that, I will top the class 10th.
This will have other benefits as nobody will expect me to top the class 10th. I contemplated all this.
Then when the result came, I was 3rd or 4th in class 9th. I was a bit hurt because I planned for 2nd position and this is after the longest time when I was not the topper. 
But my target was class 10th. In class 9th, I chose that I will score highest marks in Mathematics so that people doesnt write me off. I scored 100/100 in Mathematics. I was happy. 

Now I studied extremely hard in class 10th because I wanted to top and it was board exams. Just one month before the exam, I had prepared everything.
