# title

The title is misleading as it is not about speed reading. It is about reading better. 

1. unlearn slow reading 
2. Dont start reading from the start of a paragraph. Start from the few words after the start word.
3. skim before you start reading
4. Read with a purpose
5. Read with a pen : Try to have two fixation points per line.
6. Read with a plan
7. Read with a timer
8. learn to read slow and fast according to the content


 For 10 minutes, go at a pace so fast that you lose 10% of comprehension (this is "too fast"). Then come back, the normal will feel slow, and a slightly faster will feel normal.

## Unlearn slow reading

Whenever you find your self reading something that you could not comprehend. Try reading faster as when you slow read you mind is wandering and you are not able to comprehend.
Instead, we slow read and try to understand every word. This is not the right way to read. It takes too much time. So we need to unlearn this slow read. Read faster whenver you find yourself slow reading or not able to comprehend.Its happening bcz of distraction.
So if uyou find yourself lost in what I read its bcz I am too slow and my brain is bored. So I need to read faster.

## Dont start reading from the start of a paragraph. Start from the few words after the start word.

When you start reading from the start of a line/paragraph, you are reading the words that are not important. You are wasting your time. So start reading from the few words after the start word. This will help you to read faster and comprehend better.

It forces your eyes to use as much sensors you can. This is foveal vision. 

Tim Ferris also talked about it. 
Use peripheral vision. Instead of reading from the beginning of the line to the end of line, "Indent" your start and end reading point.
