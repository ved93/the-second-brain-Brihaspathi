I was fully preparing to top the class 10th. I had studied extremely hard because I wanted to top and it was board exams. Just one month before the exam, I had prepared everything. I was confident that I will top the class.

I felt terrible. I was not able to believe that I was not in the top 10.
I felt it so bad that I did not want to go back to school. I thought about changing the school. I was not able to face it. I was thinking how other people will look at me. They will think I am not intelligent and what not.
