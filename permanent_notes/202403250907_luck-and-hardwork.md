# Luck vs Hardwork 

Start 
Phone rang- studio- photos- form- teacher- bus stand- exam- result- luck- hardwork- Thomas Jefferson


During the summer after 5th class, I used to go to our shop after morning showers and make the shop ready for the day.
One fine morning, I went to the shop. After some time, a student came running to the shop. He said the teacher sent him. The school was just around 50 meters away from our shop where I used to study.

He said, "Sir is asking Ved to come to the school as Navodaya results have come. I still remember that moment. I was surprised."

I followed him back to the school and went to the principal's office. He said, "You have cleared The Navodaya entrance exam."

I looked at him in utter disbelief, and then he showed my roll number in the list of selected students in the newspaper. Those days we didn't have easy internet access to check the results. So results primarily appeared in newspapers. 
I was happy and surprised. 

The story started when I was in class 5th. One day, I was sitting in my father's shop, that day I didn't go to school. The landline phone started ringing. I picked up the phone and the call was from the school. I feared what had happened, and why I was on the call. The teacher explained they were filling out forms for The Navodaya Entrance exam; and they needed my photos. He asked me to have photos taken and bring them to school. I hesitated a bit, but I couldn't argue much. The teacher said today is the last day to submit the form. The teacher insisted on filling out the form because I was the topper of the class.

I went to the studio suggested by the school and got the photos clicked. While coming back from the studio, I was thinking should I fill out the form or not? I thought there was no point in filling out the form as I was not going to clear the exam. I went back to the studio, and asked him for the photos. He said it will take around half an hour. I said, "Only I will collect the photos, otherwise I won't pay for the photos." Obviously, the photographer didn't take me seriously.

This looks funny to recall but it had happened. Actually why I believed that I could not clear the exam as previous year I had taken that exam and could not pass it despite my hard work. Therefore, I thought it's not possible for me to clear it.

After half an hour, I made up my mind that I wont fill the form. Then I went back to the studio again to collect photos believing that If school dont have the photos then they cant fill out the form. When I reached the studio, the studio man said, your teacher collected the photos. I became angry and said, I wont pay for the photos. I asked him how much time had passed since my teacher collected photos. He said, just 5 minutes, and he should be at the bus stand. The bus stand was nearby and my teacher was going to submit the form in a nearby city. I thought this was my last chance. I ran to the bus stand and was looking for the teacher. Then I found him sitting on a corner chair waiting for the bus.
I went straight to him and said, "Sir, I want to cancel the application form."
He was surprised and became angry.
He said, "Now, it wont be cancelled" And I had to come back with disappointment.

Now, the time went by. Around 10 days before the exam, some chatters started in the school about the exam. A maths teacher asked in our class, who had applied for the exam? I didn't raise my hands anticipating that I wont be caught. But I was caught and there were around 10 students who had applied. We were asked to sit in the different classroom and start preparing together as the exam date was near. A few people bought the book and started preparing. I didn't buy the book. I thought I would not clear the exam. But during those 10 days, all 10 of us self-studied and solved questions.
The Exam day came and I took my exam. I was not expecting anything. 

Next day, Maths teacher asked me, "How was the exam?" I told him I dont know. But I dont remember if I solved any question wrong. But I wont clear the exam. He said, "You will clear the exam."  
He used to call me in every other class, saying that I would clear the exam. I used to feel embarrassed as I knew I wont clear the exam.
Then the result day came and my roll number was there on the list. I was the only one who got selected from my village.

Sometimes I look back and try to identify the inflection points in my life. This was one of them where It defined my future. I believe that I would not be here giving a speech in front of you if I had not cleared that exam. 

In life, we come across such moments where something happens that we never expected; and it changes our life in a way that we could have never anticipated.

Sometimes we do not get the desired results even after working hard. Sometimes we get lucky without even trying. But we should always be prepared for both. Sometimes your random decisions can change your life. When such things happen, we should not think that luck is important and hard work is not. We should always remember that hard work is the foundation of success. It is the base on which you build your life. Luck can give you a head start but hard work will take you to the finish line.
Its true that I had a bit of luck, but its equally true to say that if I had not worked hard after getting into that school then I would not be here as well.

I would like to end my speech with a quote from Thomas Jefferson, "I'm a great believer in luck, and I find the harder I work, the more I have of it." Thank you.
