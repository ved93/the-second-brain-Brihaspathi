# When I failed the first time in academics

When I had taken the first step in the college campus I decided I wont study hard but I never thought I would fail.

The first semester exams were starting. This is the first exam where I did not study at all. 
The night before the exam As they say you just need the night before exam.

I and my roommate Rishabh were studying late night. At midnight around 12-1AM, I decided to sleep and wake up early in the morning. I was carrying the belief that I need 7 hours sleep atleast before the exam. 
My friend, Rishabh was saying he will study all night. I said, "Ok, I will sleep and you study." I slept. 

He woke me up around 4-5am and said, he is going to sleep and asked me to wake him up around 7am.
I was feeling sleepy so I fell asleep again.
Then suddenly,
Somebody's voice crushed my ears and I heard its 9AM. In that 1 second I realized that exam has started and we are here in the room.
We quickly got ready and ran to the college building. The building was silent because everybody was in the exam room. Suddenly we realized that we dont know the room number and have no idea where to check our roll number. 
That time we realized that we should have checked our roll number Yesterday to check the room. We looked here and there but we could not find anything. Then we ran to the department office. We found Teaching Assistant there and asked him to help us.
He told us the room number as the building was big so difficult to know the location of the room. He again accompanied us to the few exam rooms. 
My friend rishabh found the room. Then he was helping me in finding the room. It was the first floor but we could not find the room. We were running here and there. 
I looked at my watch, It was 9:30am. 
Finally, TA said he dont know and now I only have to search it. He left and I was panicking because I thought I would not be able to give the exam. Suddenly I saw one senior in a lab and I asked and he helped me locate the room. 

It was 9:30AM-10AM, I rushed to the room. I asked for permission to enter but I was denied saying that I was late. Now I was really sad. 2 minutes after, I asked for permission again and said sir, I was late because I could not find the auto as I was coming from a distant place. He asked for the location. I gave him my other friend's location. 
I dont know if he bought it or not but he allowed me to enter the room.
He said, "Ok, you can enter but you will not get extra time." I said, "Ok, sir." I entered the room and started writing the exam.

I had around 2 hours to finish it. Finally I gave the exam and came out. 
Then, I gave the other exams as well. 

I wanted to pass the every exam and it felt like I will score passing marks.
So just before the last exam of the first semester, I had this idea that my all exams went badly, now lets do well for this last exam. 
There were people who used to study all night before the exam. I thought I will do the same. I studied all night. I was feeling confident that I will kill this exam and I will score the highest marks in this exam.
I went to the exam room feeling very confident. I got the paper and started writing. Then suddenly I started feeling very sleepy. I realized when invigilator snatched admit card from my hand to check. 
I was feeling very sleepy and I was not able to concentrate. I realized that I will fail in this exam. Every time I was able to open the eyes, I would try to write a few sentences for each question. I was thinking If I will get some time I will complete those answers. 
Just 30 minutes before exam end time, I was fully awake. I wrote like a ninja. After the exam, I was not sure if I will pass or not. 

Then the results came. I failed in first exam. I was not able to believe that I failed. I was thinking about how I failed. I felt terrible for the moment. Then I realized its fine.  
Nothing can be done now. Somehow I got the grace marks and I passed the exam.

Then, what about the exam which I wanted to top, right? Well, we got the results of that exam as well. When teaching assistent was distributing answer sheets to check the total mark, he announced my roll number, I went tpo collect the answer sheet and when he was giving ity to me, I saw the marks. it was 25/70. I handed it back to him,
he looked puzzled, I said I dont need to total it. I am satisfied. 
Actually 25 was the minimum you need to score to pass the exam. 

Thats how my exams ended for the first semester. After that I never studied whole night. I also learned atleast to check the hall tickets and room numbers before the exams.
Although I didnt learn that we should study and work on getting good marks.
