After the exam, I was checking my own math answer sheet to check if the total is correct and there was a note on one answer 
"very confusing method" Although I got the solution but teacher could not understand it fully. 
He was confused but he gave me full marks.

That was the first step in my friendship with The confusion.

I am here to confuse you with my confusion. As they say if you cant make them understand, confuse them. Jokes apart, you will be the most wise person after today. ha ha!

Or may be the most confused person ever. 

In my entire life, I know one thing that I know nothing. 
Even I dont know how much to eat. There are only two phase,
1. I am still hungry
2. I have eaten more than enough

How many of you have seen the movie Matrix? When you watch the movie, you will see that the protagonist is a computer. After watching, I started thinking about my life. What if we are in a matrix. We are doing what we asked to do. What if there is no path.
what if we are just caged and we dont know yet. 
How to make sense of the world?
what If I am optimizing for the things which I should not have?

All those questions are valid questions but it got me confused. 
What if we are in wrong career?
What if we are supposed to do something else than what we are doing Currently?

After a year, my friend got back to me and saying that he has the same questions. 

confusion of career 

Some time back, I was thinking that I will earn enough money to retire and will do whatvere I want. But recently, I started observing people and its very hard to get retire. Retirement is the work that you will be doing if no one pays you. So what if I identify what I want to do. 

You will be free of the pressure of jobs. I asked a very senior person in an interview that how long does it take to have a meaningful career in my field.
He replied it takes around 15-20 years. 

I have thought about it and I see we are not patient. We optimize for small things. 
I started having questions like what if I am 




confusion in current job

Recently I switched jobs and it had been a difficult decision to make. One, I never planned the swicth and it just happened that I cleared all rounds in small time frame and didnot put any effort.
second, I didnt plan to move to Mumbai. 

I was confused that I should join or not. Till the joining date, I didnot know. I still dont know whether I should continue in my job or not. Its not that company is not good or is not giving me good work or work pressure is high. 
Its just that I dont know why? 


Still, 

My life is full of such confusions. Your life may have your own confusions and we should not be afraid of those confusions. Acknowledging those confusions is an importnt step to clear these confusions. 

Thank you!
