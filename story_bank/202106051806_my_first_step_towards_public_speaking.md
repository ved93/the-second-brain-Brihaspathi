# First Step

## Key facts

## Critical elements

## Outline

I used to watch his facebook photos about giving speeches. I watched some of his speech videos, and he was way better than the person I knew him. He was my senior in college. Then one day I messaged him how did he improve his communication. He told me about toastmasters, and then 
I asked- Are you employed by Toastmasters? 
He said- No. This Non profit organisitaion. and told these clubs are everywhere. He told me just attend one meeting and then see.
I found one club which was 15 km away from my location Noida. I drove there and somehow I couldnt join.

Then I moved to Gurgaon. It was 2017, there was a club near me in Sriram school. I visited the club.  When I walked through the door, I was determind to join the club. I joined the club. The first time, I had taken timer role. I totally messed up in that role. I felt really bad. Then I gave 1 speech there. I mugged up the speeches and delivered. I am an introvert person so I found difficulty in interacting with people.The club was big and I couldnt interact much. I also had inferiority complex back then. Thoughts like these people are good communicator, I am not able to speak well and what will others think about me. 

I left the club after some months as most people give up. I got busy at new company and moved to different place. 
After 3 years, I thought lets join again. I asked the toastmasters members from previous group members. Then I got to know about the new club being opened at sector 56. Gaurav reached out to me about the meeting. The irony is there was a club around 300 meters away from my flat. I was living there around 1 year and I never got to know. After I paid the fees then I came to know about the club. I thought next term I will move to that club. 
But You know why I had not moved from this club. I felt belonged to this club. 
I still vividly remember that when I first time I got to speak about. My legs were shaking and I was sweating and there was too much uneasiness. And then there was one person Gaurav choudhari who was encouraging while I was speaking by nodding his head. Rest of the speech I delivered just looking at him. 

Then some good speaker visited our club and I asked him how will I get better and he said you need to have thick skin. After it, I started going to stage more often and I have a fair share of embarrassment. 
Once I have given a topic about share and I thought its sher-o-shayri one. Then table topic master said its share, I felt so embarrassed. To save myself from embarrassment, I started reading books and lecture videos. Those things did not help me at all. 

Its just the practice to show up and spveak. I always taken the opportunity to speak.
Earlier I used to be conscious and had fear of speaking. I used to go blank. Over the time, I have become better. Now it happens rarely. 

For the longest time, I tried to not giving any evaluation. I felt that I am not worthy of giving feedback. People feel discomfort giving feedback when they are not a good speaker. 
When i started giving evaluation, my evaluation used to be ended within 1:30 minute. Now I can speak more than 3 minutes for evaluation. So you will improve over time. 


The message I want to convey is that when we start our journey it will be difficult and your brain will try to convince you that you dont have time or may be you cant do that. But my friend you always have time and you can do it. members and group dont make the same mistake as I did earlier. If you be more engaged then you will feel more comfortable to talk. 
The idea you have to take the first step. Take your first step!


Thank you and over to you TMOD
