I have been thinking and reading for note taking. So the eternal question, how do we build second brain or zettelkasten.


first, whatever comes into your mind, just write it down, if you are on laptop then write it in foam inbox, or if you can grab notebook its fine.[^2] 

These will be fleeting notes which you will have to process[^5] it later. Ideally you should process daily. 

second, whenever you read something take notes and call[^3] them literature notes.

People call them fleeting notes, literature notes, permanent notes, zettelkasten, second brain, etc. 
But if you stick to one, you wont face any problem.

Literature notes contains information from the book, article, video, etc. 
these notes may not be connected to other notes.

Permanent notes are the notes which you have processed and made connections with other notes.
parmanent notes will be made from both literature notes and fleeting notes.
