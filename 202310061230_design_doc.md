# title

The idea is simple we need to have a blueprint before we start working on a project. This is a simple template that I have created for myself.





Objectives: Why are you building this?
Minimum Viable Product: What’s important for your audience?
Research and explorations: What time and resources are available?
Milestones and Results: What can and has been achieved?
TL:DR (Too Long Didn’t Read): What’s the summary?



Design doc for each
Architecture Space, Implementation Space, and Idea Space.
