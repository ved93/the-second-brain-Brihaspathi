## Borrowed credibility

I discussed with Dhruv about this concept and he said he didnt know there is a term for that. He also came across this. 

In general, we can borrow credibility from other people/plateform/company/instiutes. When we try to build something, we can borrow credibility from other people. i.e. a company who hires from top colleges becomes a top company to apply. People who work in good company are considered good. This is very common phenomenon. 
Extending this to areas like writing, i.e. when we write something and cite sources from multiple good sources, then your writing considered good and reliable. Even though what you writing can be different from the sources you are citing.
People dont care about that. Borrowed credibility is powerful and common. IMO, everyone should leverage it.
