# Data roles

There are 3 kinds of data roles exist. 

There is a lot of confusion about data science roles. It is a role that varies company to company. Today, we are going to demystify the data science roles. 

At higher level there can be three types of data roles:

1. Data Science- Analytics: These are the roles where you mostly crunch data and provide insights about it. You need some statistics knowledge to interpret the data. Here, you need to have knowledge about statistical models like linear regression and logistic regression, Normal distribution and central Limit theorem.
2. Data Science-  Algorithms: These are the roles where you mostly concerned more about engineering skill. i.e. you will need basic knowledge of ML and knowledge about API and deployment. Sort of ML engineer role.
3. Data Analyst: These are the kind of role where you mostly do data manipulation. You write queries and provides dashboards and data for business teams.

If we talk about in terms of opportunities, most data roles are analyst roles.

I will cover how to prepare for each kind of role.
