# focus and productivity

I was listening to a podcase I dont remember but it was along the lines of focus and productivity.  He said, 
"Focus is saying no to other tasks while doing one."

This line has wisdom in it. Today's world is full of distractions. We constantly get distracted by notifications, emails, twitter, calls, etc. It amazes me how addictive these things are. We have 24 hours in day but we are not able to do the things we want to do. Try to review your day and see where your time is going. Focus is the key to productivity. 

You have to force yourself to focus task at hand. When you get stuck, dont go youtube or twitter. Just sit there and think. You will get the answer.
If you keep forcing yourself to focus, you will get better at it.

You might read lots of books or articles on productivity but if you dont apply it, it is useless. Focus is everything. Ask yourself, can you do one thing and not be distrcatced by other things. i.e. If you are reading a book, just try to read for straight 30 minutes without looking at phone or anything else. If you can do that, you are on the right path.


Use 3:3:3 plan,  3 hour for most important tasks, 3 shorter tasks and 3 maintenance tasks.
