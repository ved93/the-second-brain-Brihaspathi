# Autobiography

This project is dedicated to my writing practice excercise. What I have realized is there is no way to become good at writing unless you write a lot. Writing a lot needs topics. So inspired from Anne lamot and others. I will write anything. 
Just short assignments.

I think I will start from my life. Big events and holidays. Everything I can remember from my life. 
Another thing why I want to write is that I want to tell my story.
One day my family will read it, my nephews and kids will read it. I think my story is worth telling.
So here you go!


This will serve another purpose as I will use this dump to give speeches in Toastmasters.
