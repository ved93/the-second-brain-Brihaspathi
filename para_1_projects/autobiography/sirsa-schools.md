# 1st School

Sirsa was my mother's native place. I moved to my Nani's place after my brother left. I still remember the day when my brother was not ready to stay in Sirsa. He packed his clothes in black polythin bag and was saying he wont stay here. Thats how my parents decided to send me to Sirsa.
I was in 1st class. I remeber the first school but I dont rememeber much about it. I just remember that we used to pluck java plum from the tree and eat it. 
Then I moved to another school with my elder sister.
