# title

The earliest memory I have from school is when I was being forcefully taken from home to school. 
The school was very nearby, just 1 minute walk. I think I was in 1st grade. I was crying and perhaps I was hiding away in Bua's house. Teacher had sent few boys to bring me to the school. I remember being taken to school while I could not move much as they had held my hands and legs while carrying me to the school. 
I dont remember what happened after that. I think after that I never tried to skip school till I was a child. 

The school I was studying in, a big tree tree was there under which I remember studying.
