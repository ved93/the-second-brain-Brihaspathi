Most people are still stuck with tree-based models for structured tabular data. Its a notion that deep learning is only for unstructured data and tree based models are superior for structured data. Thats partly true but recent advancements in deep learning for tabular data have shown that deep learning outperforms tree-based models in many cases.

My claim is not that deep learning beats tree-based models for structured data. Even if deep learning does not beat tree-based models, it is still worth exploring deep learning for structured data. Deep learning provides more benefits that we will explain later in the book. 

Currently we dont have any resources that guide us in the realm of deep learning for structured data. There are many resources for deep learning for unstructured data but not for structured data. This book is an attempt to fill that gap.
As the research is changing rapidly, I will keep updating the book with the latest research and advancements in the field of deep learning for structured data.

# Who is this book for?

This book is for data scientists, machine learning engineers, and deep learning practitioners who want to explore deep learning for structured data. This book is also for beginners who want to learn deep learning for structured data.
