inductive bias: A set of assumptions that the learning algorithm uses to predict outputs from inputs that it has not seen before. Inductive bias helps the algorithm generalize from the training data to the test data. For example, a decision tree algorithm may have an inductive bias that prefers shorter trees over longer trees.
