The first step in building a Second Brain is “capturing” the ideas and insights you think are worth saving. Ask yourself:

What are the recurring themes and questions that I always seem to return to in my work and life?
What insightful, high-value, impactful information do I already have access to that could be valuable?
Which knowledge do I want to interconnect, mix and match, and periodically resurface to stimulate future thinking on these subjects?
While capturing information, 
your rule of thumb should be to save anything that “resonates” with you on an intuitive level.
