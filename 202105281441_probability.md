# title

A probability space consists of a sample space S and a probability function P which takes an event A⊆S as input and returns P(A), a real number between 0 and 1, as output. The function P must satisfy the following axioms:

P(∅)=0, P(S)=1.
If A1,A2,… are disjoint events, then
P(⋃j=1∞Aj)=∑j=1∞P(Aj).
(Saying that these events are disjoint means that they are mutually exclusive: Ai∩Aj=∅ for i≠j.)


The frequentist view of probability is that it represents a long-run frequency over a large number of repetitions of an experiment: if we say a coin has probability 1/2 of Heads, that means the coin would land Heads 50% of the time if we tossed it over and over and over.

The Bayesian view of probability is that it represents a degree of belief about the event in question, so we can assign probabilities to hypotheses like ''candidate A will win the election" or ''the defendant is guilty'' even if it isn't possible to repeat the same election or the same crime over and over again.

The Bayesian and frequentist perspectives are complementary, and both will be helpful for developing intuition in later chapters. Regardless of how we choose to interpret probability, we can use the two axioms to derive other properties of probability, and these results will hold for any valid probability function.
