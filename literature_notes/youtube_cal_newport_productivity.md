- 12:20 : pre-blocking time is a great way for increasing productivity. Its different than autopilot. Auto-pilot is your prescheduling work that occurs on regular basis. Pre-blocking is a way to schedule your work in advance.
- 13:20 : Time block relaxation for work day. Once youi are in the habit of time block relaxation you tend to get more aggressive about it. So schedule 30 min relaxation break. 
- One other thing is doing admin time block where you club multiple things in single time block. But this admin block should contained cognitively similar task so that you can avoid context switching. Organise by theming the tasks. Shorter blocks of themed admin tasks is way more comfortable than having bigger blocks where you mix together different types of tasks. 
- 17:30: Email cleaning task is difficult because you are switching context. So when you schedule email cleaning, make it themed. i,.e. this time block of email cleaning, i will only check datascience newsletter mails or lets say bytebytego emails. 
- 18:20: Just block 5-15 minute break for processing last meeting tasks. May be schedule followup meeting or share meeting notes. Dont try to rush into the next meeting. Bascially close the previous meeting tasks.
- 28:10: heuristic auto pilot is something you do on regular basis. Like you do morning pages, you do weekly review, you do monthly review. Its okay sometimes to skip these. i.e. Cal Newport was saying he uses 20 minutes of drive time to think about his work. But sometimes he skips it. You dont have to treat it as hard appointment. But if you are skipping it regularly then you need to change something. like I am missing my deleberate practice routine from past couple of months.3
- 35:10: Dont consume internet media articles. Instead consume books. Do this for 30 days and you will feel that you are not missing anything.
- Make a single decision that I am a timeblock person. Its like a meta habit. You just need to be honest and decided if you want to be time block person or NOT. Then train your mind and yourself to follow that. 



## Learnings

Try to have some tasks on auto-pilot mode. Which needs to happen daily. May be try writing morning pages. Have a routine. May be first thing in the moring. I will preserve 7am-11am for my auto-pilot tasks.
