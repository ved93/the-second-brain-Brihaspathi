24. Writing paper step by step. Fleeting notes, literature notes, permanent notes, and project notes.

25. Make sure you link the notes to index or maybe create entry point for topics. The idea is to be able to find the notes when we need them.
42. project notes are the kind of notes which are only relevant to a specific project. After the project is done, you can archive them.
44. fleeting notes are only useful if you review within a day.
44. literature notes can be very brief as the context is in the book or sources they came from. permanent notes need to be atomic and self contained.  
47. nobody start from scratch when they are writing a paper or anything. 
76. literature notes can be very liquid. Always keep them handy so that you can write without any friction. Luhmann says, "after finishing the book, i go through my notes and think how these literature notes might be relevant for already written permanent notes in slip box. it means that I always readwith an eye towards possible connections in the slip box."
86. Always remember familiarity is not understanding. So always test by writing. So read for understanding first and not to learn.  
127. developing ideas: I found this interesting as auther says to think inside the box. People rarely learn from other's mistakes. One way is to ask what if question. Auther shares an example best way to learn about the function of money is remove the money from the question and ask what if question. 
Ask what not in the picture. 




## Main Ideas

Active reading and note-taking are crucial for internalizing and clarifying knowledge. Ahrens stresses the importance of actively engaging with the material while reading. He advocates for the practice of taking succinct, personal notes while reading, as this process helps internalize and clarify one's understanding of the content.

Literature Notes and Permanent Notes: The book distinguishes between two types of notes: literature notes and permanent notes. Literature notes capture information extracted from external sources, such as books, articles, or lectures, while permanent notes consist of the individual's thoughts, insights, and ideas. The Zettelkasten method positions literature notes as the foundation for generating original content in the form of permanent notes.

The Zettelkasten method hinges on the creation of atomic literature and permanent notes.
The systematic interlinking of notes enables the emergence of new ideas and associations.

The Zettelkasten Method: Ahrens introduces the Zettelkasten method, a knowledge management system that involves creating and linking individual notes to facilitate creative thinking and idea development.


Always read with the goal of writing. Writing is the only thing that matters. Nothing else matters.
This habit will transform the way you consume information. You will become better reader and thinker.

literature notes are the notes you take while reading a book or article. They are the raw material for your permanent notes. They are the ideas you dont want to forget or the ideas you want to use in your thinking or writing. 

When you make permanent notes, you look at your literature notes and fleeting notes and see how they relate to other permanent notes. Permanent notes should be atomic notes. 
Think about how they relate to your research, thinking, or interests. Include references to the permanent notes that are related and include references to the literature notes that are related.

Create connection between the notes. This is the most important part of the process.
Remember that permanent notes can be revised and expanded as your understanding of the topic evolves.
