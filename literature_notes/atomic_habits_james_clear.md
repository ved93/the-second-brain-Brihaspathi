## Atomic Habits

- reduce it to 2 minute rule task. i.e. if you want to read a book, then make it a habit of reading 2 pages of book. If you want to do yoga, then make it a habit of picking yoga mat. 
- art of showing up. i.e. go to the gym even for 15 minutes. 
- Before improving a habit, it must be established first. 
- Implementation intention: When you state your intention to implement a particular behavior at a specific time in the future. i.e. When do I meditate, I meditate on mondays at 7 in my guest room.
- People feel they lack motivation but what they really lack is clarity. They lack clear understanding of when and where the habit is going to live. 
- So two things for making a habit, make it obvious- decideing when and where its going to occur.
  second, make it easy- scaling it down and just doing it for 60 second or 2 minutes.  
- remember four laws of habit change. 
  1. make it obvious
  2. make it attractive
  3. make it easy
  4. make it satisfying
- Dont set vague goals like I want to be healthy. Instead set goals like I want to be healthy so I will go to gym on monday, wednesday and friday at 7am. Be very specific for building habits.
- Fix your habit into below formulae
    I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [ThisLOCATION]
    I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION] because [MOTIVATION] 
- Habit stacking:
  After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT]
  i.e. After I brush my teeth, I will meditate for 1 minute.
- Your trigger cue should be something that you do automatically without fail during the day.
- Motivation is overrated, you can better shape your behavior by designing your environment.
- Leverage temptation bundling. i.e. only watch your favorite show while exercising.
- Make it easy to do things you want to do and hard to do things you dont want to do.
- Make it satisfying. i.e. use habit tracker.
