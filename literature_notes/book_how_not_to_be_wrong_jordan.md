# Auther : Jordan Ellenberg

3. Abraham Wald and the Missing Bullet Holes: Its not about the data you have, its about the data you dont have. A good insight which I have used in my work.
22. Less like sweden: Author talks about the way people wrote headlines while obama was introducing health care bill. People showed the line graph. Author again share the laffer curve for tax rate and gives its history. The point is not all curves are line. 
33. Straight locally curved globally: Author gives interesting anecdotes of infinite numbers series and how it was solved. 
50. Everyone is obese: Author talks about the study which says by 2048, everyone will be obese. Author talks about the study and how it was flawed. Again makes the point that not all curves are linear.
62. How much is that in dead americans: Jordan gives example how people convert the numbers to dead americans to make it more relatable. i.e. Israel deaths during second intifada. 
We cant compare raw numbers as size of population is different. So people relied on proportion. But authors makes the point that even proportions are not comparable. As small state can change the proption drastically. It can be either very high or very low. Author gives the examples of team small and team big for flipping coins. This culminates to law of large numbers.
68. Auther talks about law of large numbers. He gives examples of best NBA players in shot accuracy and another example of best schools in north carolina state. Small schools had higher chance of winning and it was not because they were better. It was because they were small. At the same time, worst schools were also small schools. 
80. More pie than plate: Author gives examples of job loss during obama administartion and makes the point that proportion can deceive you. When you have negative numbers be extra careful. 
90. Wiggle room: which refers to the flexibility in interpreting data to fit a desired outcome. In the case of Rips and ELS, there were many degrees of freedom in choosing the nth letter, the length of the ELS sequence, and the interpretation of the resulting message. This wiggle room allowed Rips to find patterns that fit his preconceived notions but had no real statistical significance.

## Chapter Summaries

Chapter Six of "How Not to Be Wrong: The Power of Mathematical Thinking" by Jordan Ellenberg, titled "The Baltimore Stockbroker and the Bible Code," delves into the concept of probability and statistical significance, particularly in the context of finding patterns where none actually exist.

The chapter starts with a story about a stockbroker from Baltimore who sends stock predictions to people and turns out to be surprisingly accurate. However, it's revealed that this accuracy is a result of a statistical trick. The stockbroker sends predictions to a large number of people but only continues sending to those for whom the previous prediction was correct. This process is repeated multiple times. Eventually, a small subset of people receive a series of correct predictions, not realizing that the vast majority received incorrect predictions and were subsequently excluded from further mailings.

Ellenberg uses this story to illustrate the concept of survivorship bias, where we focus on the things that have passed a selection process and overlook those that did not due to lack of visibility. This bias can lead to overly optimistic beliefs or false conclusions because the failures are ignored.

The chapter also touches on the Bible Code, a theory that the Hebrew text of the Torah contains hidden messages that can be deciphered using a skip code. Critics of the Bible Code argue that similar patterns can be found in any sufficiently large text, implying that these patterns are more likely to be coincidences than meaningful messages.

Ellenberg emphasizes the importance of understanding probability and recognizing the role of chance in creating seemingly improbable outcomes. He stresses that finding a pattern in data does not necessarily mean there is a genuine phenomenon at work. It could simply be a result of random chance, particularly when dealing with large data sets.

In summary, Chapter Six of "How Not to Be Wrong" cautions against the misinterpretation of statistical data and patterns, advocating for a more skeptical and rigorous approach to evaluating claims of predictive power or hidden messages in data.   


## Chapter 7: Dead fish don't read minds

In Chapter 7 of "How Not to Be Wrong" titled "Dead Fish Don't Read Minds," Jordan Ellenberg dives into the world of data and its interpretation, emphasizing the importance of **well-designed experiments and avoiding cognitive biases**. He uses various anecdotes to illustrate his points:

* **Dead Salmon and MRIs:** This story highlights the **absurdity of drawing conclusions from flawed experiments**. Ellenberg criticizes a study that used an MRI on a dead salmon to understand how they navigate, demonstrating the need for control groups and logical setups.
* **Trial and Error in Algebra:** He discusses how **trial and error is a fundamental learning process**, even in seemingly abstract fields like mathematics. He mentions how mathematicians like George Polya advocated for this approach, encouraging exploration and experimentation.
* **Birth Control Statistics:** This section delves into the **dangers of misinterpreting data due to confounding variables**. Ellenberg uses the example of a study suggesting birth control pills caused heart attacks, which was later debunked after accounting for other factors like smoking habits.
* **Basketball's "Hot Hand":** Ellenberg explores the concept of **randomness and the illusion of streaks**. He analyzes data on basketball players' shooting percentages, demonstrating that the "hot hand" phenomenon is likely due to chance rather than any inherent ability.

Throughout the chapter, Ellenberg emphasizes the importance of:

* **Asking the right questions:** Formulating clear and relevant research questions is crucial to drawing meaningful conclusions.
* **Designing sound experiments:** Control groups, randomization, and accounting for confounding variables are essential for accurate results.
* **Acknowledging randomness:** Recognizing that chance plays a significant role in many phenomena helps avoid misinterpretations.
* **Being skeptical of claims:** Questioning data and methodology is vital before accepting conclusions, especially from sensationalized sources.

By using engaging anecdotes and clear explanations, Ellenberg encourages readers to think critically about data and avoid common pitfalls in interpreting information. Remember, as the title suggests, **just because something seems obvious or intuitive doesn't mean it's true, and dead fish definitely can't read minds!**

## Chapter 8: Reductio ad Unlikely - How Not to Be Wrong by Jordan Ellenberg

In this chapter, Ellenberg introduces the concept of **reductio ad unlikely**, a statistical reasoning tool derived from the classic **reductio ad absurdum**. Here's the gist:

**Classic Reductio ad Absurdum:**

* Assume the opposite of your claim (let's call it hypothesis H).
* Show that this leads to a **logically impossible or absurd** conclusion.
* Therefore, the original hypothesis H must be **false**.

**Reductio ad Unlikely:**

* Assume the **null hypothesis** (no significant effect) is true.
* Show that observing the actual data would be **highly improbable** under this assumption.
* This **unlikely outcome** casts doubt on the null hypothesis, making it less likely to be true.

Ellenberg explores various applications of this framework:

* **John Mitchell and the Pleiades:** Mitchell, an 18th-century astronomer, used the unlikely clustering of stars in the Pleiades to argue for a common origin of our solar system and other stars. While ultimately incorrect, his reasoning showcased the power of considering unlikely scenarios.
* **Biblical Codes:** Ellenberg debunks the claim of hidden messages in the Bible by demonstrating the statistically insignificant nature of alleged patterns. The vast amount of possible "codes" makes finding a seemingly meaningful one highly probable by chance.
* **Yitang Zhang's "Bounded Gaps" Conjecture:** In number theory, Zhang's groundbreaking conjecture relied on showing the unlikely nature of not finding certain prime number patterns under the traditional assumption. This "unlikely outcome" approach pushed the boundaries of mathematical understanding.

**Key Takeaways:**

* Reductio ad unlikely is a powerful tool to **assess the evidence** against the null hypothesis.
* Observing **improbable outcomes** suggests the null hypothesis might be **wrong**, but remember, it doesn't prove the opposite claim is true.
* This approach reminds us to consider the **plausibility of chance** and avoid being fooled by coincidences or selective data.

Ellenberg emphasizes that reductio ad unlikely is not foolproof and requires careful interpretation. However, it serves as a valuable tool for critically evaluating data and challenging assumptions, helping us think "not to be wrong."

## Chapter 9: The International Journal of Haruspicy

## Chapter 9: The International Journal of Haruspicy - How Not to Be Wrong by Jordan Ellenberg

This chapter uses a fictional journal - **The International Journal of Haruspicy**, dedicated to analyzing animal entrails for future predictions - to delve into the **pitfalls of statistical significance**. Here's a breakdown:

**Haruspicy and P-values:**

* Ellenberg draws parallels between ancient haruspices seeking meaning in entrails and modern researchers relying on **statistical significance (p-values)** to interpret data.
* He highlights the issue of **multiple testing**, where conducting numerous analyses increases the chance of finding a "significant" result even if it's just random noise.
* This chapter introduces the concept of the **"file drawer problem"**: unpublished studies with non-significant results, leading to an **overestimation of true effects** in published literature.

**Real-world Applications:**

* Ellenberg discusses the **"hot hand" phenomenon** in basketball, where players seem to be on a streak. He uses data analysis to show that these streaks are likely due to chance, not a true ability to "get hot."
* He analyzes studies linking **genes and schizophrenia**, illustrating how overreliance on p-values can lead to misleading conclusions and the need for **replication and careful interpretation**.
* The chapter also touches on the **limitations of p-values**, suggesting alternative measures like **confidence intervals** to provide a more nuanced understanding of data.

**Key Takeaways:**

* Just because a result is statistically significant (p<0.05) doesn't mean it's **truly meaningful** or generalizable.
* Multiple testing and publication bias can inflate the appearance of effects.
* We need to consider **plausibility, effect size, and replication** alongside p-values for robust conclusions.
* Statistical methods are tools, not magic answers, and require careful interpretation and awareness of limitations.

**Remember:** Just like the haruspices misinterpreting random patterns in entrails, we can be misled by data if we don't approach it critically. This chapter encourages thoughtful analysis, avoiding the allure of "significance" without due consideration.

## Chapter 10: The Triumph of Mediocrity


## Part 3: Expectations

In Part 3 of "How Not to Be Wrong," titled **Expectations**, Jordan Ellenberg dives into the realm of probability and statistics, emphasizing the role of **expectations in shaping our understanding of the world**. He uses various concepts and anecdotes to illustrate:

**The Law of Large Numbers:** This principle states that as the number of trials increases, the average outcome approaches the expected value. Ellenberg uses examples like coin flips and dice rolls to demonstrate how randomness balances out in the long run, even though individual outcomes can be unpredictable.

**Additivity of Expected Value:** He explains how expected values can be combined for complex scenarios. This principle helps assess situations with multiple possibilities and calculate the average outcome based on individual probabilities.

**Misconceptions in Probability:** Ellenberg debunks common pitfalls in interpreting probability, such as the gambler's fallacy (assuming past events affect future probabilities) and the "hot hand" fallacy (attributing streaks to skill rather than chance). He emphasizes the importance of understanding randomness and avoiding biased interpretations.

**Applications in Economics and Decision Making:** The book explores how expectations influence economic models and individual choices. Ellenberg discusses concepts like utility theory and game theory, highlighting how our understanding of expected outcomes can impact rational decision making.

**Beyond Rationality:** While advocating for clear thinking, Ellenberg acknowledges the complexities of human behavior. He discusses cognitive biases that can cloud judgment and influence how we perceive and react to data, even when we understand theoretical principles.

**Key Takeaways:**

* **Understanding expectations** is crucial for interpreting data, making decisions, and avoiding common pitfalls in judgment.
* **Probabilistic thinking** helps us navigate uncertainty and assess the likelihood of different outcomes.
* **Awareness of cognitive biases** is essential to mitigate their influence on our decision-making process.
* **Combining logic and reality**: While theoretical models provide frameworks, it's crucial to consider their limitations and adapt them to real-world contexts.

By using accessible examples and engaging explanations, Ellenberg encourages readers to think critically about the world around them. He emphasizes the importance of using quantitative reasoning and acknowledging the role of both randomness and human limitations in understanding and navigating complexity.

## Part 4: Regression

In Part 4: Regression of "How Not to Be Wrong," Jordan Ellenberg delves into the concept of **regression to the mean**, a statistical phenomenon that often surprises people and leads to misinterpretations. Here's a summary of the key points:

**Regression to the Mean:**

* This principle states that **extreme values tend to move closer to the average over time**. For example, students with exceptionally high test scores on one exam are likely to score closer to the average on the next one, simply due to chance and random variation.
* Ellenberg uses various examples to illustrate this, including test scores, sports performance, and stock prices. He emphasizes that **regression does not imply causation**. Just because someone performs poorly after a high score doesn't mean they lost ability, it's simply a natural fluctuation around the average.

**Misconceptions and Applications:**

* The book debunks common misinterpretations of regression, like mistaking it for decline or failure. It highlights the importance of considering **long-term trends and underlying factors** alongside regression when drawing conclusions.
* Ellenberg explores real-world applications in various fields:
    * **Education:** Understanding regression helps avoid misjudging interventions based on short-term fluctuations in student performance.
    * **Medicine:** Recognizing regression is crucial when evaluating the effectiveness of treatments, as fluctuations around the average can occur even without the treatment itself causing any change.
    * **Sports:** Regression helps analyze player performance objectively, understanding that hot streaks often regress to the mean, and individual athletes can't sustain exceptional performance indefinitely.

**Beyond the Average:**

* While regression focuses on the mean, Ellenberg acknowledges the **diversity of individual trajectories**. Not everyone regresses equally, and other factors can influence outcomes.
* He emphasizes the importance of **critical thinking and considering context** when applying regression concepts to real-world situations.

**Key Takeaways:**

* Understanding regression to the mean is crucial for **interpreting data and avoiding misinterpretations**.
* Regression does not imply causation or decline, it simply reflects a natural statistical phenomenon.
* Applying regression effectively requires **considering context, individual variability, and long-term trends**.
* Critical thinking and awareness of limitations are essential when using regression in real-world scenarios.

By providing accessible explanations and diverse examples, Ellenberg encourages readers to use regression as a tool for understanding the world around them, while emphasizing the need for careful interpretation and avoiding overly simplistic conclusions.

## Part 5: Existence

Chapter 18 of "How Not to Be Wrong," titled "Out of Nothing I Have Created a Strange New Universe," explores the fascinating world of **non-Euclidean geometry** and its impact on mathematics and our understanding of the universe. Here's a breakdown of the key points:

**János Bolyai and the Fifth Postulate:**

* The chapter centers around the story of **János Bolyai**, a young mathematician who independently discovered **non-Euclidean geometry**. This system differed from traditional Euclidean geometry by rejecting the fifth postulate (parallel lines never meet).
* Ellenberg highlights Bolyai's struggle for recognition and the initial resistance to his revolutionary ideas. However, Bolyai's work, along with Nikolai Lobachevsky's independent discovery, opened a new realm of geometric possibilities.

**Beyond Flat Surfaces:**

* Non-Euclidean geometries describe **curved spaces** where the familiar rules of Euclidean geometry, like the Pythagorean theorem, don't hold true. Ellenberg uses analogies to spheres and hyperbolic surfaces to help visualize these concepts.
* He discusses the impact of these geometries on our understanding of the universe, exploring how Einstein's general theory of relativity relies on non-Euclidean geometry to describe spacetime.

**Formalism and the Search for Truth:**

* The chapter also delves into the **philosophical debate** between **formalism** (focusing on the internal consistency of mathematical systems) and **realism** (believing these systems represent an underlying reality).
* Ellenberg explores how mathematicians like David Hilbert wrestled with these questions and how the existence of non-Euclidean geometries challenged traditional views on the nature of mathematical truth.

**Key Takeaways:**

* Non-Euclidean geometry represents a significant shift in our understanding of space and mathematics.
* Its discovery highlights the creativity and imagination inherent in mathematical exploration.
* The debate between formalism and realism remains relevant as mathematicians continue to push the boundaries of the unknown.

By weaving together historical anecdotes, mathematical concepts, and philosophical questions, Ellenberg encourages readers to appreciate the **power and beauty of non-Euclidean geometry**, not just as a mathematical abstraction, but also for its potential impact on our understanding of the universe itself.
