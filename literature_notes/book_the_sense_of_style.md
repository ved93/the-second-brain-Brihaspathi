## Author: Steven Pinker


26. talked about good writing practices. fresh wording and concrete imagery. They write as if they have something important to say. But not only that, they write as if they have something important to **show**
28. classic style is characterized by clear, direct, and coherent prose. The guiding metaphor of classic style is seeing the world. The writer can see something that the reader has not yet noticed, and he is trying to enable the reader to see it for himself.
45. substitute "damn/fuck" every time you inclined to write very.
46. Avoid cliche 
76. Top escape from curse of knowledge, show draft to yourself, ideally after enough time has passed that the text is ni longer familiar 
96. easiest way to repair sentence is to look at the second coordinate and then force the first coordinate to match it by sliding its quantifier into more suitable spot.
105. delete needless words. i.e. several kinds of verbiage are perenial target for delete key. Light verbs such as **make,do, have, bring, put and take** often do nothing but create a slot for zombie noun, as in make apperance or put on performance. Corrected: appear with, perform. 
108. Think about right branching tree. Its easy to grasp even though its long. 
119. Think about garden paths. Garden path are sentence with ambiguity.      
124. structural parallelism: If the new phrase has the same structure as the preceding one, its called structual parallelism. Example- we shall fight in beaches, we shall fight in landings. etc.
130. Save heaviest for the last: A big heavier phrase easier to handle if it comes at the end of the sentence.
131. Topic, then comment.Guven, then new:  This principle involves structuring sentences and paragraphs in a way that begins with the topic or the known information, followed by the comment or the new information or perspective about the topic. This structure is sometimes referred to as the "given-new" pattern.
The principle of topic, then comment, given, then new, can be applied to paragraphs as well. The first sentence of a paragraph should introduce the topic or the main idea, and the rest of the paragraph should provide supporting details and information.
146. coherence begins with the writer and reader being clear about the topic. The topic corresponds to the small territory withing vast web of knowledge into which the incoming senetences should be merged. 
148. Together with the topic of a text, reader usually needs to know its point. The point is the message that the writer wants to convey about the topic. Remember research paper, they provide abstract/summary at the beginning.
174. Avoid writing negatively. i.e. not unimportant. Instead write important.
176. Avoid hedging. i.e. using allegedly, supposedly, presumably, etc.
176. Writing is often clearer and more elegant when a writer pushes an *only* or a *not* next to the thing it quantifies.     


## Main Ideas and Summary

The Sense of Style by Steven Pinker is a book about writing style. Pinker argues that good style is not a matter of personal taste or a mystery to be solved by a few experts. Instead, he says, it can be understood as a form of communication that can be explained by science and learned by anyone who wants to write well. Pinker's book is divided into three parts: the first part explains why style matters; the second part describes how to write clearly and concisely; and the third part offers advice on how to improve your own writing style.

## chapter 2 

is titled "A window onto the world". Steven says writing is window through which reader can see the world and effective writing serves as clear and unobstructed pane of glass. 
Steven explored common pitfalls to avoid like cliche, metadiscourse(talking abstruction in abstraction),  signposting, hedging(i.e. using allegedly), passive voice, zombie nounn(i.e. nominalization), and jargon.

## chapter 3: the curse of knowledge
Pinker introduces several real-world examples to illustrate the curse of knowledge. He shows how writers who are experts in a field often assume that their readers possess the same level of knowledge, leading to jargon-filled and confusing prose. This tendency is the curse that hinders effective communication.

The chapter provides practical advice on how writers can overcome the curse of knowledge. Pinker emphasizes the importance of putting oneself in the reader's shoes and making an effort to see the text from their perspective. This involves using concrete examples, analogies, and metaphors to bridge the gap in understanding between the expert and the non-expert.

To escape from the curse of knowledge, share draft with other people and get feedback.
The author revise the draft twice before sharing with others. First revision is to make sure that the draft says what the author wants to say. Second revision is to make sure that the draft says what the author wants to say in a way that the reader can understand.

## chapter 4: the web, the tree, and the string

Pinker introduces readers to three contrasting metaphors that can be used to understand the structure of language: the web, the tree, and the string.

The Web: This metaphor views language as a complex, interconnected web of words and concepts. In this view, words are interconnected, and the meaning of a word is influenced by its relationships to other words and concepts. This perspective highlights the richness and ambiguity of language.

The Tree: The tree metaphor represents language as a hierarchical structure, with words and concepts branching out from one another. Each word has a specific place in the hierarchy, and meaning is derived from this hierarchical arrangement. This view of language is often associated with traditional grammar.

The String: The string metaphor sees language as a linear sequence of words, much like a sentence. It is a straightforward and linear way of thinking about language, where meaning is conveyed through the linear order of words.

While writing think that reader read in terms of tree implicitely. So write in such a way that reader can easily follow the tree.

## chapter 5: Arcs of coherence

 Pinker explores the idea of coherence in writing and how it can be achieved by creating a clear and engaging narrative. Here's a summary of Chapter 5:

Chapter 5 delves into the concept of coherence, which refers to the quality of a text that allows readers to understand the relationships between sentences and paragraphs, making the narrative flow smoothly and logically. Pinker introduces the idea that good writing is like a well-constructed story, with a beginning, middle, and end, and that maintaining coherence is essential for effective communication.

Pinker presents various strategies and techniques to achieve coherence in writing, including:

Thematic Structure: He discusses the importance of organizing a text around a central theme or thesis, allowing readers to follow the development of ideas from the beginning to the end.

Transitional Devices: Pinker explores the use of transitional words, phrases, and sentences to signal shifts in the narrative, helping readers understand the logical connections between ideas.

Narrative Flow: He emphasizes the significance of narrative flow, which involves structuring information in a way that guides readers from one point to the next naturally and effortlessly.

Signposts and Roadmaps: Pinker introduces the idea of providing clear signposts and roadmaps for readers to orient them within the text, ensuring they know where they are and where they are headed.

The chapter also discusses how to maintain coherence while revising and editing a text. Pinker highlights that revisions should be guided by the overall arc of the narrative and the clarity of the message. He provides practical examples and advice on how to achieve coherence in various types of writing, such as essays, reports, and scientific papers.
