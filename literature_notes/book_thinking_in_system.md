# Thinking in Systems

## Author: Donella H. Meadows

2. System thinking is a way of thinking that gives us freedom to identify the root cause of the problems and see new opportunities.
3. It is a way of thinking that helps us to see the world as a whole and not just as a sum of its parts.
7. The behavior of the system cannot be known just by knowing the elements of which the system is made.
11. A system is an interconnected set of elements that is coherently organized in a way that achieves something. A system must consists of three things:
    - Elements
    - Interconnections
    - Function or purpose 
12. the elements of the systems are often easiest to identify, bcz many of them are visible and tangible things. The elements that make up a tree are roots, trunk, branches, leaves, and so on. If you look more closely, you see specialized cells; vessels carrying fluids up and down. 
13. Most often we start listing the elements of a system when we try to understand it. Better way is to stop disecting elements and start looking at the interconnections, the relationships that hold the elements together. 
14. information based relationships are hard to see, functions or purpose of the system are even harder to see. The best way to deduce system's purpose is to watch for a while to see how the system behaves.  
18. A stock is the memory of the history of changing flows within the system.
23. A stock generally change slowly, even when teh flows into or out of them change suddenly. Therefor, stocks act as delays or buffers or shock absorbers in the system.
24. If you see a behavior that persists over time, there is likely a mechanism creating that consistent behavior. That is feedback loop.
30. Balancing feedback loops are those that tend to maintain equilibrium in a system. They are goal seeking.
31. Reinforcing loops are found wherever a system element has the ability to reproduce itself or grow as constant frac of itself. They are self-enhancing.  
75. Why systems work so well? bcz resilience, self-organization, or hierarchy.
